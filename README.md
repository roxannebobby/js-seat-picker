# Custom Seat Picker Project Information

This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop a custom seat picker chart. Javascript was used to customize the behavior of the seat selections, as well as the ticket and pricing calculations.

This project was developed utlizing a tutorial by Brad Traversy. When possible my code strays from the tutorial to practice the skills taught in the lesson.
